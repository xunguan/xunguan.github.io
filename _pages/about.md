I am now an assistant professor at [Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute (TBSI)](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

I mainly work in **Intelligent Photonics, Electronics and Information System (iPEIS)**. I use photonic and electronic techniques to solve problems in telecommunication, sensing, information technology and others.

Prior to that, I was a Research Scientist in [Optical Communications Laboratory](https://ocl.fsg.ulaval.ca/) at [Centre of Optics, Photonics and Laser (COPL)](https://www.copl.ulaval.ca/accueil/) in [Universit&eacute; Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca/), Quebec City, Canada, where I still hold adjunct professorship.

Openings: Check [this link](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/2022/0530/c3680a54039/page.htm) for our graduate students admission summer camp to be held this July. I'm recruiting outstanding master and doctor students starting in Sept. 2023; my working area is Intelligent Photonics, Electronics and Information System. Interested applicants are encouraged to apply for the summer camp or contact me directly; we also appreciate professors to circulate this post to possible candidates. 

欢迎推免清华大学深圳国际研究生院/清华-伯克利深圳学院。计划招录2023年9月入学的优秀硕士博士生；我的工作方向是智能光电与信息系统。欢迎感兴趣的同学报名参加夏令营，与我联系。也请各位老师推荐优秀的学生报名。
