# News
A paper in collaboration with [Prof. Leslie Ann Rusch](https://ocl.fsg.ulaval.ca/team/leslie-rusch) of Universit&eacute; Laval, <em>'Expanded Modal Capacity for OAM with Standard 2Ã—2 MIMO'</em>, has been accepted to [ECOC2022](https://www.ecoc2022.org/).

# Brief Intro
I am now an assistant professor at [Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute (TBSI)](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

I mainly work in **Intelligent Photonics, Electronics and Information System (iPEIS)**. I use photonic and electronic techniques to solve problems in telecommunication, sensing, information technology and others.

Prior to that, I was a Research Scientist in [Optical Communications Laboratory](https://ocl.fsg.ulaval.ca/) at [Centre of Optics, Photonics and Laser (COPL)](https://www.copl.ulaval.ca/accueil/) in [Universit&eacute; Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca/), Quebec City, Canada, where I still hold adjunct professorship.
