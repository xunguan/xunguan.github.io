I am now an assistant professor at [Tsinghua Berkeley Shenzhen Institute (TBSI)](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

I mainly work in **Intelligent Photonics, Electronics and Information System (iPEIS)**. I use photonic and electronic techniques to solve problems in telecommunication, sensing, information technology and others.

Prior to that, I worked as a Research Scientist in [Optical Communications Laboratory](https://ocl.fsg.ulaval.ca/) at [Centre of Optics, Photonics and Laser (COPL)](https://www.copl.ulaval.ca/accueil/) in [Universit&eacute; Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca/), Quebec City, Canada.

Openings: Check [this link](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/2022/0530/c3680a54039/page.htm) for our graduate students admission summer camp. Welcome to join Tsinghua SIGS/TBSI. We are recruiting outstanding master and doctor students starting in Sept. 2023; my working area is Intelligent Photonics, Electronics and Information System. Interested applicants are encouraged to apply for the summer camp; we also appreciate professors to refer this post to possible candidates.
